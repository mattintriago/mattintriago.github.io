## OOP Principles

1) Encapsulation 

	Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.

For example, we are hiding the `name` and `dob` attributes of person class in the below code snippet.

Encapsulation — private instance variable and public accessor methods.

2)  Abstraction
	
	Abstract means a concept or an Idea which is not associated with any particular instance Using abstract class/Interface we express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation. In a way, one class should not know the inner details of another in order to use it, just knowing the interfaces should be good enough.

only use the stack when possible never the heap
